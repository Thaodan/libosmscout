This is a package that allows you to import OpenStreetMap maps
distributed as PBF. To use,

1. Unpack this archive

2. In terminal, run import.sh included in this archive with for each
PBF map that you would want to import (one map in a time). For
example:

  libosmscout-importer.Linux.x86_64/import.sh estonia-latest.osm.pbf

After that, the directory with the corresponding name will be
created. The script strips the following suffixes from the file name:

-latest.osm.pbf
.osm.pbf
.pbf

In the example case above, a directory estonia will be created and the
map will be imported into that directory.

3. Copy the imported folder to your device (internal disk or SD card)
and point the program using libosmscout to that folder.
