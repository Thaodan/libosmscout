This is a package that allows you to import OpenStreetMap maps
distributed as PBF. To use,

1. Unpack this archive

2. Copy PBF into the unpacked folder libosmscout-importer

3. Open terminal and change to that unpacked folder

4. Run ./import.sh for each PBF map that you would want to import. For
example:

./import.sh estonia-latest.osm.pbf

After that, the directory with the corresponding name will be
created. The script strips the following suffixes from the file name:

-latest.osm.pbf
.osm.pbf
.pbf
