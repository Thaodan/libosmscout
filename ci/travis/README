For adding deployment in Travis:

* In .travis.yml, specify your email, where appropriate

* Add GitHub project to your projects in Travis

* Follow https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/ to fill
  the missing data in .travis.yml:

     * You may have to use "force" option or delete deployment section
       in .travis.yml before running

           travis setup releases --force

       Running this script will make a new personal access token on
       GitHub, in addition to changes in .travis.yml

     * Write down the secure key from new .travis.yml, you will need
     it later

     * Restore your previous .travis.yml from git:

          git checkout .travis.yml

     * In .travis.yml, insert your secure key as well as repo under
       deploy, as indicated by comments.

* On each build, an importer tool will be generated. On release or
  tags, this tool is uploaded to GitHub as an attachment to the
  release.
