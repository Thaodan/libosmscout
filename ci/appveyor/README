* Add GitHub project to your projects in AppVeyor

* In AppVeyor project settings, go to Environment.

     * There define environment variable GITHUB_TOKEN with the token
       that you can generate at https://github.com/settings/tokens

     * Save the Settings 

* On each build, an importer tool will be generated and put as a build

  an attachment to the release.
